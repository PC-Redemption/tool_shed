# Project Map: Tool Shed evolution

Status: complete
Type: project-map
Updated: 2026-08-20
Next Action: none
Campaign: standalone
Campaign Reason: completed coordination surface; future work requires a new bounded request or campaign

## Purpose

Coordinate post-foundation Tool Shed improvements that change workspace routing, disconnected
snapshot updates, and the lifecycle of project-specific work artifacts.

## Zoom Levels

30,000 ft:

- Overall outcome: Tool Shed stays aligned with project planning and can be safely refreshed across workspaces.
- Success shape: drift becomes visible without automatic rewrites, and snapshot updates preserve project work.

10,000 ft:

- Major workstreams: artifact reconciliation; request routing and guarded fleet
  snapshot updates; generated-evidence prevention and reversible migration; privacy-safe workspace
  performance measurement; evaluation and implementation of transferable planning mechanisms;
  campaign-entry discussion, adaptive coordination, token efficiency, and cross-provider product portability.
- Key dependency preserved: distribution to existing snapshots remains a separate, explicitly
  approved operation.

1,000 ft:

- Completed routing and updater workpackage:
  `work/wp/completed/wp-tool-shed-routing-and-fleet-snapshot-updates.md`.
- Other completed workpackages include
  `work/wp/completed/wp-generated-evidence-safety-and-migration.md` and
  `work/wp/completed/wp-tool-shed-campaign-entry-improvements.md`.
- Completed workpackages: `work/wp/completed/wp-work-artifact-reconciliation.md`.
- Completed installer ticket:
  `work/tickets/ticket-portable-verified-tool-shed-installer.md`.
- Active execution-level ticket:
  none; numbered execution levels are complete.
- Completed Direct-route mitigation:
  `work/tickets/ticket-mitigate-tool-shed-churn-for-direct-coding-requests.md`.
- Completed performance ticket:
  `work/tickets/ticket-implement-privacy-safe-workspace-performance-profiler.md`.
- Completed planning-model evaluation:
  `work/spikes/spike-evaluate-human-planning-models-for-tool-shed.md`.
- Open decisions: none within this completed map; future CI-policy or fleet-update work requires a
  new bounded request.

Ground:

- Current next action: none; the owner abandoned the fleet-update campaign without applying it.
- Owner/context: human and Codex in the canonical Tool Shed development workspace.
- Verification: focused unit tests plus `python3 scripts/validate_tool_shed.py`.

## Dependency Notes

- Reconciliation guidance was shipped through its reviewed release path.
- Any future fleet update remains a separate guarded operation and is not authorized by this map.
- Generated-evidence improvements must pass varied disposable workspace profiles
  before they are distributed to existing workspaces.
- Migration apply work must remain gated by an exact manifest, verified archive,
  and human approval.
- Portable installer work must preserve stable-tag selection and two-commit
  provenance verification; cloning `main` is not an acceptable release source.

## Current Navigation

You are here:

- All intended Tool Shed evolution workstreams in this map are complete. The first fleet-update
  campaign was abandoned without applying changes to other workspaces.

Do next:

- [x] Finish focused reconciliation tests.
- [x] Run the complete repository validator.
- [x] Add a `ts: help` operator guide and skill route.
- [x] Add authoritative snapshot version and update-status checks.
- [x] Harden equal-version mismatch, version bumps, provenance, and plan-drift scope.
- [x] Complete the `0.2.0` pre-release hardening checklist.
- [x] Define workspace-profile fields, local-policy precedence, relative signals,
  and hard safety limits.
- [x] Treat the imported incident as one regression profile in a broader matrix.
- [x] Define and validate prepare-only and human-gated apply contracts.
- [x] Implement the stable-tag, cross-platform snapshot updater and rollback tests.
- [x] Verify the complete validator matrix in native Windows and Linux CI.
- [x] Pass launcher runtime fallback against disposable Windows and Linux workspaces.
- [x] Review current-workspace findings; the owner declined a fleet update and Campaign 019 was abandoned.
- [x] Define the workspace-performance report schema, privacy boundary, benchmark protocol, and fleet rollout plan.
- [x] Implement and canary the privacy-safe local workspace profiler.
- [x] Evaluate transferable human planning mechanisms and recommend proportionate Tool Shed updates.
- [x] Qualify, release, deploy, and fresh-task verify evidence-responsive execution guidance.
- [x] Finalize and implement the discussion route, adaptive token-efficiency, and cross-provider portability design.
- [x] Qualify existing-snapshot replacement and rollback for the compact Markdown skill layout.
- [x] Publish the qualified portability release, synchronize the installed Codex client, and fresh-task verify.
- [x] Mitigate Direct-route churn and verify ordinary, `ts:ask`, and ship-adjacent fixtures.
- [x] Implement and validate numbered work levels with combined and split environment models.
- [x] Implement and work2-verify owner-facing campaign queues under `work/00-campaigns/`.
- [x] Publish a complete AI command reference and refresh the README/operator guide.

Avoid for now:

- Do not update other repositories or installed snapshots before explicit review and approval.
- Do not make the reconciliation command rewrite artifacts.
- Do not test migration against the original firmware workspace or mutate its
  evidence; use a disposable fixture.
- Do not combine current-snapshot cleanup with Git-history rewriting.
