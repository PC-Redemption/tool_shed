## Request

After public v0.28.0 verification, use the dual-role workspace procedure to quick-validate the released source skill, exact-diff source and installed copies, create one bounded timestamped backup, stage and replace the installed skill, verify exact parity, and perform one fresh-session routing/readiness smoke. Do not rerun the full repository validator or modify downstream project snapshots.

## Completion Check

G2-RELEASE-USABLE passes with exact installed-skill parity and fresh-session evidence.
