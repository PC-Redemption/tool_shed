Depends On: none
Decision: none

Completion Gate: GitHub issue #39 acceptance criteria pass: the doctor command audits the full supported workspace surface; detects stale indexes and dirty campaign transitions; distinguishes structural consistency from unsupported runtime claims; emits compact human and stable JSON results with actionable verdicts; strict mode fails for unhealthy required states; repair remains explicit and guarded; focused regression tests pass; and command, operator, skill, and snapshot documentation are updated.
