Primary Focus Areas: snapshot-delivery
Supporting Focus Areas: provider-portability, workspace-safety, qualification-release
Depends On: synchronize-maintainer-skill-and-smoke-v0-28-0

Completion Gate: G4-WINDOWS-INSTALLED-WORKS passes with version, resolver, asset-aware execution, exactly-once verification, journal, and usage evidence.
Completion Evidence: G4-WINDOWS-INSTALLED-WORKS passed. Core v0.29.4 snapshot and skill are current; exact GUI Codex 0.149.0-alpha.4.3 and executable hash were project-qualified without PATH preparation; fresh asset-aware Campaign 017 changed only two declared paths, verified exactly once, ended safe and verified, used 38,324 input/38,703 total tokens in 13.031s, and used zero dispatcher model tokens with no nested Codex. Campaign 013 was not replayed and Bactron was not deployed. See work/evidence/evidence-bactron-core-native-windows-app-server-workflow.md.

## Request

Using normal GUI execution on the work PC in E:\dev\bactron-core, upgrade the Tool Shed snapshot and Windows installed skill from the verified v0.28.0 release with bounded backups and rollback. Without PATH preparation, verify that all App Server consumers select the same exact GUI-provided Codex executable and readiness state. Create and execute one fresh bounded non-production asset-aware Core campaign through explicit App Server selection, capturing model/effort, context, tokens, turns, elapsed time, tool calls, changed paths, exactly-once declared verification, journal truth, and compact return. Repair ordinary setup defects inside this campaign with focused checks and one smoke. Do not replay Campaign 013, deploy Bactron, alter unrelated product scope, or run unrelated suites.

## Completion Check

G4-WINDOWS-INSTALLED-WORKS passes with version, resolver, asset-aware execution, exactly-once verification, journal, and usage evidence.
